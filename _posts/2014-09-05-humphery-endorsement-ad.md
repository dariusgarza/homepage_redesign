### Mayday.US Releases Senator Gordon Humphrey Endorsement Ad

#### Polling shows Rubens surging ahead of Smith, closing gap with Brown in Primary

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Mayday.US released [a television and radio ad by former New Hampshire Senator Gordon Humphrey](https://mayday.us/rubens/), a Republican who served two terms in the United States Senate, endorsing Jim Rubens for in the Republican Primary for Senate. “I’ve known Jim Rubens for decades,” the former Senator says on the ad, “he’s real &ndash; a reformer who wants to clean up corruption in Washington.”

The ad is released just as new polling by Public Policy Polling, conducted between Aug 27-28 and September 2-3, finds Jim Rubens moving ahead of Bob Smith and closing the gap with assumed front-runner Scott Brown at a rapid pace (2 Public Policy Polling memos attached). Ruben's doubled the votes of Smith and cut Brown's lead in half within a week and 20% of the race is still undecided. The support of Brown in New Hampshire has proved to be a mile wide but an inch deep in the final weeks of the campaign.

“I am incredibly happy that former Republican Senator Humphrey has stepped back into the public’s eye to endorse Jim Rubens,” Mark McKinnon, said Republican strategist and co-founder of Mayday.US. “Senator Humphrey himself was an important conservative reformer. Like Jim Rubens, he pledged to serve just two terms in the Senate. Like Jim Rubens, he believes we must clean up the corruption in Washington.”

“70% of New Hampshire Republicans believe it ‘important to reduce the influence of money in politics,” commented Lawrence Lessig, co-founder of Mayday.US, “Jim Rubens is the only Republican candidate for Senate in the Nation to call for reform of the way campaigns are funded,”

“When likely voters in the upcoming election hear about Jim Rubens and Scott Brown, they move swiftly in the direction of Rubens,” continued Lessig, “As we all know, anything can happen on Election Day, and we intend to send shockwaves through the political establishment on Tuesday.”

#### Full Text of the Endorsement:

> As New Hampshire Republicans, you and I have a critical choice.
> Between Jim Rubens, Union Leaders “Citizens of the Year,” who’s lived here 40 years, and Scott Brown, the guy who’s just moved up here from Massachusetts.
> I’ve known Jim Rubens for decades - he’s real.
> A reformer who wants to clean up the corruption in Washington.
> Like me, he’s pledged to only serve two terms.
> Massachusetts doesn’t need a third Senator.
> America needs new leadership.
> Please, vote for Jim Rubens.
