Labor Day is a celebration of workers, unifying in the spirit of brotherhood and equality to bring prosperity to our Democracy. Before you head out of town for this final summer weekend or prepare for the festive barbecue with your family and friends, please take a moment to watch our new video that seeks to win back that same Democracy from the cronies who hold it hostage.

Our goal has never been an easy one. Most thought we would not raise the first $1M. And many more told us we would not raise the second $5M. Our victory on Tuesday with Ruben Gallego’s win for reform energized me, and I hope it had the same effect on you. But if we truly want to be successful in this difficult task of fundamentally changing the way elections are funded in America, it’s going to take more than just you and me – it is going to take a movement.

We need to amplify our voices and bring together everyone who cares about the corruption plaguing our government. We made this video to inspire citizens to join us, because together, we have the power to fix this broken system and win our Democracy back.

You and I both know that as long as our representatives are held hostage to their funders — and their funders are not all of us — our system will not work. But nothing important is easy. And nothing could be as important as this.

Please watch and share with five friends in celebration of Labor Day and re-building a Democracy that we can be proud of.
